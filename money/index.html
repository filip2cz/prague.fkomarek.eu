        <p>
            First of all, <b>DO NOT exchange money on the street</b>, even if it looks like that he just pulled it out of an ATM!<br>
            Most of them are outdated Belarusian rubles, which are no longer valid even in Belarus, let alone in the Czech Republic.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The official currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech crowns (Česká koruna).<br>
            You can usually pay with a foreign card, but it's always a good idea to have at least a few crowns in cash.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You can exchange at the exchange office, but remember:<br>
            1 EUR = from 21 to 26 CZK<br>
            1 USD = from 20 to 25 CZK<br>
            If you are not sure, just write 1 EUR to CZK into Google.<br>
        </p>
